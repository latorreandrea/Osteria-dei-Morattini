## Project goal: Make your reservation!

The main purpose of the site is to allow customers to book a table or, if necessary, to rent the entire room for a private event (such as a wedding or a corporate dinner)


### User Goals:

The user would like to book one or more guests for a meal in a restaurant and a particular time and date.

### Site owner's goal:

The site owner would like the ability to take online bookings for their eatery.

### Features:

- Date/Time-based bookings
- Avoid double bookings
- Multiple table occupancies
- Cancellations
- Menu
- Reminder

# Skeleton:

I used Balsamiq to create wireframes for devices I used it bearing in mind that the primary objective is to invite the user to book a table for the restaurant (which in this way is advantageous for the management of spaces especially during the period of covid restrictions):

### Home Page:
The landing page where the user will arrive: from here he can explore the history and menu of the restaurant and, last but not least, access the table reservation system:

### Booking system 1/2:
The main part of the reservation system where the user books the table, the number of seats, the day and time of the meal

### Booking system 2/2:
After completing the first phase of the reservation, this screen will summarize the main data of the request, and will collect the user's personal data. 
If a reservation with the same name, email or telephone number already exists on that date, the reservation is blocked.

### Group Reservation:
This screen will open for users who want to reserve the entire venue for an event: such as a wedding or corporate event
